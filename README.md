# FreeBSDYoga
Config for a Thinkpad Yoga S1 running FreeBSD

These settings should give a fairly well optimised setup for a laptop running FreeBSD, they cover power management, display settings, some acpi config and make the trackpad work nicely, it's not as nice as a macboook however.

Added to github as I frequently mess with this machine and lose my settings!
